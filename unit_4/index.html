		<h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>
		<p> Sharon, the Foxxy Mama believed that all you had to do was find a way. I am Sharon's daughter, my name is Melanie and I learned the way most of us learn about allergies- the hard way. I am allergic to tomatoes. My first thought was no more spaghetti. I felt like something was missing in my life. I remember the rich taste of tomato sauce bursting on my tongue, the aroma, and the texture of a great sauce. I decided not to live without it and began to experiment with this brainchild of mine; would it really be possible to come anywhere near to a true spaghetti sauce?</p>
